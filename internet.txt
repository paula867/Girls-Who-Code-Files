#Electricity, radio waves and light (glass cables) work together to transfer data throughout the world. Wifi uses routers
#to pick up info. The wifi allows data to be collected and the router to be passed on to cables. Routers also make sure that 
#all the packages of info are all being sent. IP addresses make sure the packages go to the correct device. Protocol asks if 
#website is save to load into and grants permission. DNS addentifies the nature of a website (public, private, etc). A server has
#all the necessary information stored to log in to websites and pass on info. HTTP and HTML are what mandate the way a website 
#looks. URL is the unique adress needed to access a website.
